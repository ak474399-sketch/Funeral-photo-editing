## Choosing the Right Photo

The most important step in memorial photo preparation is selecting an image that truly captures the essence of your loved one. Look for photos where they appear natural, happy, and recognizable.

### What Makes a Good Memorial Photo

- **Clear face** — The face should be clearly visible and well-lit
- **Genuine expression** — A natural smile or peaceful expression works best
- **Recent photo** — Choose something relatively recent, unless the family prefers a younger image
- **Good resolution** — Higher resolution photos produce better results

## From Casual to Formal

Not every family photo is immediately suitable for a funeral service. Our AI tools can help transform a casual photograph into a dignified, formal portrait:

1. **Background removal** — Replace busy backgrounds with clean, solid colors
2. **Attire adjustment** — AI can replace casual clothing with formal attire
3. **Color correction** — Ensure proper lighting and color balance

## Preserving Heritage

For older, black and white photographs, colorization technology can bring new warmth to vintage images while preserving their historical character. This is especially meaningful for multi-generational family tributes.

## Creating a Complete Memorial Set

Consider preparing a complete set that includes:

- A formal portrait for the service
- A memorial poster with dates and meaningful text
- Social media-sized images for online tributes
- Print-ready files for physical memorials

Each piece serves a different purpose in honoring your loved one's memory.
